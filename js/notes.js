//* by putting "!" we can revert it's type to a boolean and value to false.

//* we can only modify existing propery of a "Sealed Object", but can not add/delete a new property to it.

//* because emojis/emoticons ka "Unicode" compare ho rha hai and wo same hai isliye it will return "true".

//* kisi boolean value ke pehle "+ plus" sign lagane se wo value number me convert ho jaati hai.

//* Because empty Array [] & empty Object {} are the true values!

//*  empty string "" is also a falsy value. par "OR" operator ko koi positive/true value nhi milti to ye last falsy value return kr deta hai.

//* jab bhi "delete namesArr[1]"" array se koi element delete krte hai to "deleted index" pr "empty space" create kr dega. but array ki length same rahegi.

//* Double star "**" Will play a role of "power" so => 3 to the power 3 will give us 27. and "***" will give us an Error.

//* if we compare "boolean" with "number": it will return "false"

//* for loop will execute continuously and because "var v" is global varibale so it's why value of "var v" will increase from 0 to 5 in the memory location and setTimeOut will execute at the end in "callStack" that is why the setTimeOut will print 5 5 5 5 5

//*  string ke aage + lagane se wo string number me convert ho jaati hai
